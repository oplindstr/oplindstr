Hi!

My name is Olli-Pekka Lindstr√∂m. 

I'm interested in finding solutions to, or helping with, practical real-world problems using software development. It's exciting when it's clearly visible that a piece of software handles a problem more effectively than what was previously possible or achieved!

I'm interested in many different areas of software development and computer science in general, ranging from website development and DevOps to machine learning, for example.
