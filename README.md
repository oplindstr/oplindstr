Hi!

My name is Olli-Pekka Lindstr√∂m. 

I'm interested in finding solutions to, or helping with, practical real-world problems using software development. It's exciting when it's clearly visible that a piece of software handles a problem more effectively than what was previously possible or achieved!

I'm interested in many different areas of software development and computer science in general, ranging from website development and DevOps to machine learning, for example.

My experience is still mostly work or school related, with the exception of the website of the student organization Matrix ry, which is purely a hobby project.

I haven't been very active here lately, since I have been concentrating on work since graduating and the latter portion of my studies didn't include very much coding, but I'm looking to fix the situation in the near future.
